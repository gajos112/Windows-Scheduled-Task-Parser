# Windows-Scheduled-Task-Parser
Windows Scheduled Task Parser - DFIR's tool parsing XML-based Windows Scheduled Tasks.

# How does it work?
First of all, if you want to understand how this tool works, you need to understand the structure of Windows Scheduled Task. The entire structure is exmplained by Microsoft under that link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/task-scheduler-schema. This is the documentaion that I was used creating that tool.
